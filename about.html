    <p>Spawned in Germany during 1984, KMFDM pioneered the crossover between techno/dance and heavy metal with their signature industrial sound. Moving to Chicago in the mid-80' s KMFDM was the pride of Wax Trax Records during the label’s peak. Rapidly evolving year by year through intense experimentation and touring; the band has redefined themselves with each new release.

Venturing on to dabble in side projects and then re-establish KMFDM in Seattle during 1999, Sascha’s revolving band of misfits have stood the test of time. To quote themselves, “The future belongs to those of us still willing to get our hands dirty”. Living by their D.I.Y. philosophy, KMFDM launched their own online store, KMFDM Store and record label, (KMFDM Records).

Helmed by the dual vocal attack of the band’s founder Sascha and siren Lucia KMFDM celebrated 20 years of musical excellence by performing 62 shows in the US, Canada, Europe and Australia in 2004. In 2005 they embarked on a World Tour of 18 countries in support of their full length CD Hau Ruck. 2006 saw the release of a new remix EP titled Ruck Zuck and the Hau Ruck Zuck USSA Tour. 2007 brought Tohuvabohu, featuring a grand mixture of the band’s many styles. In 2008 the band, now relocated to hometown Hamburg, Germany released their first full blown remix album ever, Brimborium.

Celebrating their 24th Anniversary on February 29th 2008, KMFDM announced KMFDM 24/7, a series of twenty four seven inch vinyl singles featuring tracks from the band's original 12" singles and classic album cuts. The singles were released by KMFDM Records on the first of every month in the order they were originally released for 24 months culminating on Feb 01, 2010 with the brand new exclusive single Day Of Light. Each of the 24 singles were available in a Limited Edition First and Only Pressing of 250 copies. All tracks were remastered specifically for vinyl and the covers for all the singles featured original classic KMFDM artwork, most by famed KMFDM cohort Brute!. All KMFDM 24/7 releases were exclusive to the KMFDM Store.</p>
