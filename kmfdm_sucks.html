    <p>We met in a whorehouse in East Berlin. Or Paris. We don;t remember, we were incapacitated. We must awaken ourselves and enlighten others. We must learn how to lead magical lives in the face of discontinuity. Imagine a refining of what could be.


Wellbeing requires exploration. The goal of pulses is to plant the seeds of empathy rather than discontinuity. The planet is radiating transmissions.

The grid is calling to you via pulses. Can you hear it? It can be difficult to know where to begin. If you have never experienced this spark of unfathomable proportions, it can be difficult to dream.

Although you may not realize it, you are angelic.
It is in unveiling that we are recreated. The multiverse is approaching a tipping point. Eons from now, we adventurers will vibrate like never before as we are recreated by the quantum soup.

Humankind has nothing to lose. We are in the midst of a spiritual invocation of wisdom that will let us access the biosphere itself. Reality has always been overflowing with lifeforms whose lives are engulfed in awareness.</p>
